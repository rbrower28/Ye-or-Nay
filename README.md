# "Ye or Nay??"

In this iPhone-based trivia app, you are given 10 randomly
generated quotes.

The game is simple: were these quotes said by world-renowned
music artist Kanye West or by a famous world figure? Choose 
Kanye by anwering "Ye" and choose somebody else with "Nay".

After each answer is selected, you will be given the name of
the author (whether it be Kanye or someone else), and it will
tell you if you are right or wrong!

Keep an eye on the high score! As your score updates, it will
also update the high score. Don't worry about losing your
progress though! The app uses User Defaults as local storage,
meaning that the next time you get on the app you'll still
keep you highest score.
